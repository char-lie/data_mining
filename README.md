Natural Language Processing in Python

## Target

We have unique words in a text.
We want to have weights of words and we have three methods:
- TF-IDF. Wickness: frequent words are not necessary unnecessary.
    - For every word
    - For pairs of words
    - For triads of words
- Diffusion method

In the end we want to have a network of words with connections.
